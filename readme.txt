Design Decisions

I chose to make it clear that there was a search mechanism by
allowing the user to see one field, which is clearly labeled
as a search for artist field.

I put this field in the center of the viewport, in a banner that
subtly drew attention. I provided an example as a placeholder,
and the label above the form field, so that the user can always
see what they are typing for.

I made it clear that there were advanced options by adding an
advanced link next to the for field, as an a tag.

I made the button a bright color that says "SEARCH", to make it
clear what the goal of the field was. At first glance, you would
read the "Spotify" text and the "Search" text, and immediately
understand what the goal of the site was.

Furthermore, I changed the
cursor to a pointer, and added an on hover color transition so that
the user feels like they are going to press a button. The all caps,
as well as the increased character spacing, allows the button
to be more readable.

Pressing the advanced button opens up more fields, which are all
consistent in styling and in content. It is clear what each field
requires, and the user can fill out as many field as they want
and search for their track. This gives the user many freedoms, as
they may not know all the details of their track.

Furthermore, I persist the artist name between the two forms, so
that the user does not have to retype them. If a user wants to do
a more advanced search, the artist name will remain in the new artist
field, and the user can continue to the other ones. Each placeholder
contains instructions on what needs to be inputted in the field.
